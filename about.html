                        Not sure where to go next? Norwalk Community College is a great place to start your college career. If you don’t know what type of job you want later, NCC is the place to find out. If you are not sure if college is for you, NCC can help you decide. Our faculty is here to teach students, not to worry about getting published. Our teachers teach. And our students learn. Once you find out how much fun some courses can be, you may decide to go on to a full four-year college. That’s cool, NCC credits are fully transferable. You can start here and finish somewhere else.

                        At NCC we take a hands-on approach to learning. You’ll learn the theories behind your chosen field, as well as have the opportunity to put them into practice. In our classrooms, you will work with computers loaded with the latest software, and you will develop film in our photography labs, hone your artistic talents in our graphic design and art studios, learn to speak another language in our language labs, produce live shows in our television studio, and prepare fine food in our culinary arts kitchens and hospitality suites.
                        <br><br>
                        And we can help you earn course credit while working in the “real world” to see if your chosen course of study fits your needs and dreams. At NCC, we let you put your education to work.

                        This is the 21st Century, and technology is moving quickly. Many of our students have attended college before, but have found that their skills need to be updated in this fast-changing world. Whether you are looking to add a degree or learn new skills that can help with an existing career or hobby, NCC has what you are looking for.

This is especially important if you are still checking things out in an attempt to find the career or major that works best for you. A full year at NCC will cost you less than just a term will somewhere else.
